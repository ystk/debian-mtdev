mtdev - Multitouch Protocol Translation Library (MIT license)

To build, you need to have the autoconf and libtool packages
installed. Then, do

   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   make

To test an MT device at /dev/input/eventX, do

   sudo ./test/mtdev-test /dev/input/eventX

You should be able to see MT events in the terminal. After five
seconds of inactivity, the program exits.

To install mtdev, do

   sudo make install

By default, mtdev installs to /usr/local. To change, use the --prefix
configure option.

Enjoy,
Henrik
